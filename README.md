This project contains a Drupal 9 demonstration project (based on the [Drupal Composer/Drupal Project
template](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project/)) that is part of the "Intro to DDEV"
workshop presented by DrupalEasy.

This project includes all Composer dependencies, support for hosting on Pantheon, as well as both a
database backup and a files/ directory backup.
